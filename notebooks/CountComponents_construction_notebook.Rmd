Given some set of points, $\mathbb{X}$, and some $\epsilon$ within which 
two points are connected, we scan through the adjacency matrix and count how
many components there are. 

```{r}
library(magrittr)
##### Step 1: Count Single Points ####
rs <- adjmat %>%
  rowSums()

singlePoints <- rs[rs == 0] %>%
  names() %>%
  as.numeric()

am2 <- adjmat[-singlePoints, -singlePoints]
```

```{r}
##### Step 2: DBSCAN ####
connectedComponents <- am2 %>%
  FredsVietorisRips::FredsDBSCAN(1) %>%
  length()
```


```{r}
##### Step 3: Total Components ####
totalComponents <- length(singlePoints) + connectedComponents
```
